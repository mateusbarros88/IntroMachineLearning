abstract={In this paper a handwritten recognition algorithm based on structural characteristics, histograms and profiles, is presented. The well-known horizontal and vertical histograms are used, in combination with the newly introduced radial histogram, out-in radial and in-out radial profiles for representing 32 times; 32 matrices of characters, as 280-dimension vectors. The recognition process has been supported by a lexical component based on dynamic acyclic FSAs (Finite-State-Automata).},
