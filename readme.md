02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Modeling
=======================================

This is the Work conducted by Poul K. Sørensen and Martin Tange in the course 02450 at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). 


The course is separated into three assignments involving:  
1. 	Data: Feature extraction, and visualization.  
2.	Supervised learning: Classification and regression.  
3.	Unsupervised learning: Clustering and density estimation.  

Data: Feature extraction, and visualization
----------------------------------------------
Deadline: 5th of March 2013.

We are working with the MNISK Digit Dataset and this section will involve feature extraction and some basic statistics analysis of the data/features.
