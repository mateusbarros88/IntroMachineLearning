\chapter{Classification}

\section{Problem}
% Explain which classification problem you have chosen to solve

\section{Classification techniques}
% Apply at least three of the following methods:
% (Use cross-validation to select relevant parameters in an inner cross-validation
% loop and give in a table the performance results for the methods evaluated
% on the same cross-validation splits on the outer cross-validation loop, i.e. you
% should use two levels of cross-validation).

\subsection{Decision Trees}
\subsection{Logistic/Multinomial Regression}
\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}
\subsection{Na√Øve Bayes}
\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)}


\section{New data observation}
% For the models you are able to interpret explain how a new data observation
% is classified.
% (If you have multiple models fitted, (i.e., one for each cross-validation split)
% either focus on one of these fitted models or consider fitting one model for
% the optimal setting of the parameters estimated by cross-validation to all the
% data.)


\section{Performance comparison}
% Statistically compare the performance of the two best performing models (i.e.,
% use a paired t-test). Compare in addition if the performance of your models
% are better than simply predicting all outputs to be the largest class in the
% training data.
