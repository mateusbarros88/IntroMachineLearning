\chapter{Data and Feature Extraction}
%What is the problem of interest.
%Where did we obtain the data.(already answered)
%What have been done to the data before(A lot, but havent written much about it. People are using it still for benchmarks and people are down to less than 40 errors of the 10000 test examples))
%Explain what the primary machien learning modeling aim is as well as how you envision the data can be analysed in therms of; a classification, a regression a clustering, and association mining and an anomaly detection problem. (You need to outline how all the methods may be applied to your data)

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter the data are presented and how the features have been extracted are outlined.

\chapter{Data Analysis}
%A detailed explanation of the attributes of the data. discrete/continos, nominal/ordinal/interval/radio). Data issues like missing values, corrupted data. The basic summary statistics of the attributes.

\section{Introduction}
Introduce what this chapter is about.


\section{Basic Statistic Properties}

\chapter{Discussion}
%What have we learned about the data.

\section{Conclusion}
%Summarize that we have included all the relevant information from the questions raised in the assignment text and tell how good a job we have done.
