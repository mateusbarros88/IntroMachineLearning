\chapter{Discussion}
We have learned from our data set and its features that they are a viable candidate for machine learning purposes and this course through different visualizations of deviation, correlation and PCA on the attributes. 

We do not have very meaningful attributes when they stand by themselves, i.e. the amount of pixels in the third row is pretty unimportant negligible. However, together the attributes compliment each other well and makes it very possible to see good correlation within the classes as well as being able to distinguish them and their digits apart.

The data set has also shown to be quite viable for further analysis and for applying various machine learning techniques. We can already see ways of being able to classify most of the numbers with good reliability, and doing further modelling will only help in this regard.

\section{Conclusion}
%Summarize that we have included all the relevant information from the questions raised in the assignment text and tell how good a job we have done.
