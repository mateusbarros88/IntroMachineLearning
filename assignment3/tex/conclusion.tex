\chapter{Discussion}
In this report we have only solved some of the task asked being limited in time an by some tasks not as trivial on our dataset. 

In clustering we had a had time finding any proper way of visualizing and showing clusters. One of the tasks that would make most sense with clustering would be to cluster the digits base on the classes. 

Fitting the GMM was not that trivial as it required significant amount of CPU time. We tried to evaluate by only fitting a few classes and clustering them. 

We didn't manage to get the data transformed to binary and doing the associative mining in time.

We decided it would be fun to see what digits got the highest outlier score based on KNN with 5 neighbours, expecting it to find some numbers we would as humans would classify as being a little odd. We show that this was truth, and there was some digits with some funny shapes that we would have a hard time telling to be its correct digits. But the problem about outliers is to tell when its an outlier when there are multiply of these digits that look a bit funny. 

 
\chapter{Conclusion}
This assignment have room for improvements. There was some sections that have been skipped out due poor time management, but overall we tried to cover the topics as good as we could.
