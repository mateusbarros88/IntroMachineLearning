\chapter{Introduction}
This report is made in regard to the course \textsf{\courseno\ \coursename} at DTU (Technical University of Denmark). In this third assignment we tackle the problems of finding clusters in our data set as well as trying to cluster them based on their class. We also look at anomaly/outlier detection to see if we can find some digits which are just not normal in the way they are drawn. We have not shown any association mining as we did not see how this fit to our features at all, since they are so random. \\


All the work carried out in this report are done by Tange, M. K. and SÃ¸rensen, P. K. and the code can be found on github\footnote{https://github.com/mktange/IntroMachineLearning}. Do note that the code have only been used to generate plots and illustrations for the report and some playing around. There have been done no effort into readability or re-usability of the code.

\section{Data}
The same data as from assignment one have been used, a feature representation of the MNIST dataset. The representation consist of 272 features calculated from vertical, horizontal and radial histograms together with two profiles; in-out, out-in. Refer the first assignments for the full description.
